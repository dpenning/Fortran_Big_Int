c 	This Project can store and manipulate multiple bigints.
c 	We allocate space for a linked list of bigintegers
c 	Each BigInt is stored with its size as the first int
c 	and its sign as the second int. The rest of the integers
c 	from [2,size+2] are the values of the bigint
c 	The system is "BigEndian" in that the least signifigant
c       value is the start of the bigint
c
c 	you will notice that the printing does not neccessarily 
c 	represent what is on the requirements. this is because
c 	you are misrepresenting the base with extra zeroes
c 	on the end of a number. This is why I wrote my own value
c 	printer that correctly prints the number in its base
c
c 	the easy fix for this is to just use '(*,I3)' but that
c 	seems lazy

c 	MAIN PROJECT
c %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
c 	This is the start of the main project

c 	the storage space for integers
c 	is located at i_bigint_storage
c 	the base is i_base
c 	the the number of iterations is defined by
c 	i_iterations

c 	a value of 1 is initialized
c 	then that value is added to itself to produce 2
c 	then that value is added to itself to make 4 and so on

c 	INIT
c %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
c 	This subroutine initializes the Bigint Storage
c 	it puts the value of 0 in all 3000 spots
c 	in spot 1 it puts -1 to signal the end of the
c 	"linked list"

c 	This function takes in the bigint storage space as i_bis
c %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	subroutine init(i_bis)
	integer i_bis(3000)
	do 6 iter = 1,3000
	i_bis(iter) = 0
  6	i_bis(1) = -1
	end

c 	ALLOCATE
c %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
c 	This suybroutines finds the next place to create a bigint
c 	in the linked list by finding the last index and
c 	building the bigint there

c 	This function takes in the bigint storage space as i_bis
c 	the number of digits as i_digits
c 	and the location of the new bigint is saved as i_loc
c %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	subroutine allocate(i_bis,i_digits,i_loc)
	integer i_bis(3000)
	integer i_digits
	integer i_loc
	i_bii = 1

  	i_bis(i_bii) = i_digits
  	i_bis(i_bii+1) = 0

c 	NORMALIZE
c %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
c 	This subroutine normalizes the bigint
c 	in other words, it takes (36)base_10 and turns it 
c 	into (6,3)base_10 (big endian of course)
c 	This function assumes that you have the necessary storage space
c 	to perform this operation. in other words your bigint needs
c 	to have extra digits if it is going to be normalized and is 
c 	too large.

c 	the add function uses this to control the output bigint
c 	then the shorten function helps out the normalize function
c 	by shortening the added value if need be
c %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	subroutine normalize_bigint(i_bis,i_loc,i_digit)
	integer i_bis(3000)
	integer i_loc
	integer i_digit
	integer i_length
	integer i_quotient
	i_length = i_bis(i_loc)
  	do 100 i_iter = i_loc+2,i_loc+1+i_length
  	if (i_bis(i_iter)-i_digit) 101,102,102
  102	i_quotient = i_bis(i_iter)/i_digit
  	if (i_quotient) 103,103,104
  104	i_bis(i_iter) = i_bis(i_iter)-(i_quotient*i_digit)
  	i_bis(i_iter+1) = i_bis(i_iter+1) + i_quotient
  103	continue
  101	continue
  100	continue
  	end

c 	SHORTEN
c %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
c 	This subroutine shortens a bigint if it is too long for its
c 	memory size. this means that it will change its length if it can
c 	if the bigint is not at the end of the linked list it will
c 	cause link problems and overwrite problems, but it should only
c 	be used by the add function so im not as worried about that
c %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  	integer i_bis(3000)
